Could be a thing to look into visualising it and converting it to other formats.

[Collections](https://github.com/CHI-Performance/Performance-Collections). 
Will be done to make it easier to branch the data and

It means that the data will be seberated into sub-repositories 
than to have it all collected into one repository.
